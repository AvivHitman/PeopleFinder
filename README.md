# People Finder

This app is a simple application which displays randomly generated user information in a list, using the `randomuser.me` API.

- Filters functionality - fetch users by the selected country/counerties
- Each user has a favorite icon
- Favorite user is persistent - refreshing or closing the site will not reset the favorites
- All the favorite users are displayed in the `Favorite page`
- Infinity Scroll (pagination) which fetch additional users and add them to the list once scrolling all the way down
